# Shaping culture

- There is no room for egos on a rocket ship
- Time is money but speed is free
    - The most cost effective strategy for attracting the right talent, keeping customers engaged, and outmanoeuvring competition is to adopt a culture of a **rapid pace.**

# Managing Scale

- study those ahead of you
- outsource as much as possible
- send praise in slack, get on a call for criticism, Black and white text lacks nuance
- Overcommunicate internally. Visibility is key in a remote company
- Good managers deflect, demur, or redirect compliments back at their team or others

# Marketing first sales

- early-stage sales means never saying no to a target client
- in the early stages, optimize for growth, not revenue

# Marketing

- your intuition as a marketer is only as good as your interactions with customers. The more customer interactions you have, the better your gut judgement.
- Never underestimate the power of a user survey
- Stories are worth exponentially more than dollars. Invest in customer stories and logos. prospects want to know who else is using your product
- For content and design, never compromise high standards for high volume.

# Product

- speed is a differentiator. A reputation for rapidly delivering is a reason customers stay engaged and prospects keep coming back.
- Product always win. If you don't have a good product, you don't have a chance. **The product is what ultimately sells itself**
